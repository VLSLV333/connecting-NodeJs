Dai Boze, Vladyslav!
nodeMon is used to watch changes in run time, seems like it only follows js files, but needs to be checked and need to dive 
dipper in it's abilities! The most interesting question - can it follow html files?

Feels like it can follow html = https://github.com/remy/nodemon/blob/HEAD/doc/requireable.md
ext: 'js json' = line to follow all js and json files

Didn't work for me in tutorial LUL=)
